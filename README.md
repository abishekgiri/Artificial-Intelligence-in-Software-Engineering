# Artificial-Intelligence-in-Software-Engineering

My research explores how Artificial Intelligence is transforming modern software engineering across coding, debugging, testing, and organizational workflows. Through an analysis of five peer-reviewed studies, I examine both the technical capabilities of large language models—such as automated code generation, conversational program repair, and AI-driven test creation—and the significant risks they introduce, including security vulnerabilities, incorrect logic, bias, and over reliance.

This work emphasizes that while AI can dramatically improve productivity and lower barriers to entry, safe and effective adoption requires strong human oversight, ethical governance, and rigorous validation. My research ultimately highlights the importance of treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, ensuring that innovation in software engineering remains secure, transparent, and aligned with human judgment.
